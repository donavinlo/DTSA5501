<!-- Code chunk - states the code and type of code it is -->
```{r setup, include=FALSE}  
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown (This is a level two header. Compare it to what it looks like in markdown)

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

<!-- The **Knit** bolds that word -->
When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

<!-- #Named this chunk cars. markdown executes the commands that are in the chunk -->
```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

<!-- Code to install package that allows to knit to PDF. Only need to due once on each machine used -->
<!-- install.packages("tinytex") -->
<!-- tinytex::install_tinytex() -->


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:
<!-- Chunk is named 'pressur'. The 'echo = FALSE' means the code won't be displayed when displaying the plot -->
```{r pressure}
plot(pressure)
```

<!-- Put inline code in text by using backticks -->
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

# Things to always do in R Markdown

* Use relative and not absolute paths
    + "../filename" goes up one level
    + "/Data/filename.csv" would access the *filename* in the Data folder of your current directory
* Put any data you are using in a data folder
    + if(!file.exists("Data")){dir.create("Data")}
* Show the code for any assignment you are turning in unless instructed otherwise
    + make sure 'echo=True' is always on
* Comment out lines that you use for debugging you code
* Include your test cases and their output when needed
* At the very end put an R chunk that has sessioninfo()
    + This will document in document the levels and editions of packages used

# Things to never do in R Markdown

* setwd
    + don't want to set the directory on someone elses computer
* install packages

# Helpful tips

* name code chunks (each name must be unique)
    + When document knits it tells where problem occurs
* knit frequently
    + any substantial change or code. Check to make sure it works
* Try out commans in the console first, the put in code chunks
    + can help prevent knitting issues
    + can try in console, got to history tab and 'put in source' once you get it to work
* If you can't get it to knit, set eval=FALSE in the problem chunk until you can debug it
    + allows us to work on other things until we deubg it
    
# Shorcuts that may help on mac
- cmd + option + I will insert a new chunk
- cmd + shift + enter will run that code chunk
- can exclude the whole chunk by making 'include=' set to FALSE
- can remove warning messages by making 'messages=' set to FALSE
